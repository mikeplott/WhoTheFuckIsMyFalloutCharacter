  "You come from Ronto. You were part of a local settlment and served on its government.  But after some raiders came and killed your wife, you now spend your days hunting them down.",
  "You come from the NCR.  You were part of the NCR Army but after a battle with the Legion, you were seperated from your unit, only to find them all dead. Since then, you have just been wandering through the desert trying to find home.",
  "You come from Vault 13.  You were sent outside to try and establish contact with anyone who may still be alive.  Your vault was isolated for 200 years so you had no knowledge of the outside world and this whole world is very foreign to you.",
